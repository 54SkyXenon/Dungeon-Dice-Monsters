# Dungeon-Dice-Monsters
EDIT: THIS IS THE BUGGY UNFINISHED VERSION SORRY
Brandon Liang's APCS A final project for Per. 1 Reid 2016-2017.
This is a spinoff of the original Dungeon Dice Monsters game in Yugioh Season 0 (1998) from episodes 25-27.

The rules were found in a game at the end of a Yugioh manga volume.
I added character avatars from numerous unrelated anime, and used YGO music throughout the game.

To run, download Greenfoot and open the project.greenfoot file.
Compiling the project to a JAR causes some errors that I still don't know the exact reasons for.

Enjoy!
